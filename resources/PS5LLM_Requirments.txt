GENERAL POWERSHELL REQUIREMENTS (APPLY TO ALL FUNCTIONS)

1) COMPATIBILITY
   - MUST run on Windows PowerShell 5/5.1 and PowerShell 7+ on Windows/macOS/Linux.

2) AUTOMATIC/RESERVED VARIABLES
   - MUST NOT assign to automatic variables: $IsWindows, $IsMacOS, $IsLinux, $args.
   - MUST NOT use reserved $Args. Use unique parameter/local names.

3) EXTERNAL TOOLS
   - IF an external tool is required (e.g., dotnet, robocopy), THEN fail fast with a clear, actionable error when it is missing.

4) NAMING
   - USE ONLY PS5/5.1 approved verbs.
   - PREFER singular nouns (plural may be an alias, not the primary noun).

5) SHOULDPROCESS / PIPELINE
   - DO NOT include SupportsShouldProcess; DO NOT implement -WhatIf or -Confirm.
   - DO NOT use ValueFromPipeline or ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName.

6) FLAGS & POLICY PARAMETERS
   - AVOID default-true switches for policy/behavior.
   - USE [ValidateSet()] string parameters instead (e.g., InstallationPolicy 'Trusted'|'Untrusted', State 'Enabled'|'Disabled').

7) ERROR BEHAVIOR
   - ASSUME caller may set $ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'.
   - USE try/catch only where it adds value; rethrow with concise, actionable messages.

8) OUTPUT & LOGGING
   - EMIT Write-Host ONLY for key actions (created X, added/removed Y, enabled/disabled Z, updated trust). Keep minimal and consistent.
   - DO NOT use Write-Output, Write-Error, Write-Verbose, or Write-Information.

9) IDEMPOTENCY
   - FUNCTIONS MUST be idempotent: repeated runs converge to the same state without errors or drift.

10) DOCUMENTATION
    - PROVIDE comment-based help: Synopsis, Description, Parameters, Examples, Notes.
    - Examples should cover all relevant case dont serveral if applicable, no examples that are possible but do not make sense.

11) TEXT & STYLE
    - KEEP code ASCII-only.
    - KEEP implementations lean, readable, and reviewer-friendly (brief inline comments from an external reviewer’s perspective).
    
12) SYNTAX
    - Enforced ternary ban: Submissions MUST NOT contain the C-style ternary pattern ? : anywhere use if else instead.
    - Double-check for C-style ternary operators—the pattern is easy to overlook because it feels natural (cond ? a : b), ? : should be if { } else { }, every ? need to be checked.

13) BEHAVIOR 
    - Do not make changes that a not requested, if you spot a previous error write a statement about it in the end.

14) INLINE HELPERS (SAFE MODE)
    - SCOPE: Inline (nested) helpers defined with function MUST be created in the local scope: function local:Name { ... }.
    - NAMING: Use a distinct prefix to avoid collisions, e.g. _ (example: function local:_Norm-List { [Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessage("PSUseApprovedVerbs","")] param(...params...) ...code... }).
    - NO OUTPUT: Helpers MUST NOT write to the pipeline. If needed, return values explicitly and keep them inside the outer function.
    - QUIET LOGGING: Helpers MUST NOT use Write-Output, Write-Error, Write-Verbose, or Write-Information. Use Write-Host only in the outer function for key actions.
    - NO EXPORT: Inline helpers MUST NOT be exported; they exist only for the duration of the outer function call.
    - IDEMPOTENT: Helpers MUST NOT rely on session-global state; they must be deterministic given their inputs.

DEFINITE: A function is "DONE" only if it meets ALL requirements above.
